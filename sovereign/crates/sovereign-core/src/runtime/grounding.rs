//! Production grounding gate — the runtime port of the chaos-bench
//! critic (`bench_cmd/live_runner.rs::verify_grounding`), wired into
//! the KQ synthesis stream as **hold → gate → retry → abstain**.
//!
//! Mechanism (validated on two corpora, 2026-06-11): the synthesized
//! answer's single central claim is extracted (one small completion),
//! then checked per-retrieved-chunk with a forced-choice logprob pass
//! ("does THIS passage support THIS claim"); `violation_prob = 1 −
//! max(per-chunk support)`. On the contamination-free holdout bank the
//! verdicts separated cleanly: fabricated claims scored 0.96–1.00,
//! the highest-scoring CORRECT answer 0.45 — and every gated answer on
//! both banks contained genuine confabulation (zero false positives).
//!
//! Gate semantics, in order:
//!   1. `vp < τ`  → release the answer unchanged.
//!   2. `vp ≥ τ`  → ONE retry: re-synthesize with the failed claim
//!      quoted back as a constraint (minimal best-of-N — the second
//!      draft knows exactly which assertion failed verification).
//!   3. retry still `≥ τ` → release a grounded abstention instead.
//!      The user gets "your sources don't establish this" — never the
//!      confabulation.
//!
//! Env surface: `SOVEREIGN_GROUNDING_GATE=1` turns the gate on
//! (default off — A/B-able, desktop opt-in); `SOVEREIGN_GV_THRESHOLD`
//! tunes τ (default 0.9, from the dual-bank shadow sweeps).
//!
//! Scope guards (same as the bench critic): long-form answers
//! (>1800 chars) pass ungated — one extracted claim is the wrong
//! instrument for an essay; declines and explicitly GK-attributed
//! answers extract as NO_CLAIM and pass (the honest OOD-caveat case
//! must not be gated).
