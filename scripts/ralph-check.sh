# The ralph queue's check macros, one verb each — the command a worker types
# for CLEAN / LINT / TEST(c) / LAYER / TOML / DOCS / NODE(d) / DEMO / TESTALL /
# PREPUSH in a queue's PROMPT.md check table (ralph/next/<campaign>/PROMPT.md).

#   scripts/ralph-check.sh clean

#   scripts/ralph-check.sh node sovereign/apps/ring-doc
#
# Each runs the gate into target/ralph/<check>.log, prints `exit=N`, tails the
# log, and exits N. Why a script and not the inline string it replaces: the
# worker now runs as `claude -p` under an allowlist (ralph/claude-settings.json),
# and a command carrying `$?` or a redirect never matches a rule, prefix or
# exact — every macro asked the operator once per session (2026-09-17,
# log-permissions.txt 22:58-23:00). One verb, one rule: Bash(scripts/ralph-check.sh *).
#
# The macros' own rules are kept here, not re-decided:
#   clean  — no lock wrapper (at the 256G ceiling it is a du and never runs
#            cargo; the build-latency campaign holds the lock ~19 min a build)
#   lint / test / layer / docs / testall — through scripts/with-cargo-lock.sh
