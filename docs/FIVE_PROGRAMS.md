# Five programs — the idiomatic design, and the cut that gets there

Drafted 2026-09-17. Supersedes the ten-context decomposition in
`quality/DOMAINS.md` §4 and the `domains` campaign's relocation plan. Keeps
`sovereign/ARCH_PRINCIPLES.md` whole and the four-verdict rule. Everything
here is either a measurement taken on 2026-09-17 against `ralph/domains-campaign`
or a decision; the decisions are marked.

## 1. The product

Sovereign answers a question from what you already have, says where the
answer came from, and declines when it cannot.

That sentence is served by five programs joined by two wires everyone already
speaks: OpenAI-compatible HTTP for turns and completions, MCP for tools.
Composition is by process. One program dials another; none embeds another;
each owns its own config file, data directory and log. The crate graph is a
build detail, not architecture.

## 2. The five

| Program | Shape | Wire it serves | Owns on disk | Exists today as |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `svrn` | knowledge server | MCP `ask`, `search`, `atoms_lookup`; HTTP `/v1/chat/completions` | corpus indexes, conversations | `corpus-mcp/` (three verbs, lifted) + the turn path in `sovereign-core` |
| `svrn ingest` | recipe pipeline | CLI only | the index directory it writes | `sovereign-recipes/` + `corpus-engine` extractors, chunkers, index |
| `cmnwlth` | endpoint router with a roster | HTTP `/v1/*` proxied, OICP manifest | roster, adverts, decision log | `commonwealth/` package (lifted, `scripts/cw-rails-lift.sh`) + the serving cluster |
| `svrn code` | LSP for agents | MCP `symbols`, `callers`, `blast`, …; HTTP `/v1/completions` (FIM) | SCIP index, notes | `sovereign/crates/sovereign-tools/src/code/`, `corpus-engine-scip`, `corpus-engine-notes`, `packages/vscode-sovereign/` |
| `svrn bench` | evaluator | none; dials a URL | banks, baselines, verdict tables | `sovereign/bench/` lanes, `sovereign-eval` minus its product links |

Clients are not programs. The desktop, the phone, a coding harness, Open WebUI
and `curl` are all clients of the two wires and are built and prioritised as
clients. The desktop already links only `sovereign-contracts`, `sovereign-time`,
`sovereign-tools-base` and `sovereign-turn-client` (its `Cargo.toml`,
2026-09-17); it is the reference client, not the product.

## 3. The verdict is a schema

The differentiator is that an answer carries its own checking. It is a type,
not a runtime:

```
Answer { text, claims: [Claim], verdict: Verdict }
Claim  { text, evidence: [Citation], verdict: Verdict }
Verdict = Supported | Unsupported | CouldNotJudge | Abstained
```

`Verdict`, `GroundingDecision`, `Citation` and `ClaimCitation` already exist
in `sovereign-core`. The design moves them to `sovereign-contracts` so every
client and the bench read one definition, and makes `Abstained` a value the
wire carries rather than a branch the runtime takes. Absence is reported,
never defaulted (ARCH principle 6).

## 4. Rules each program obeys

1. One data directory, one owner. A second process never opens it; it dials.
2. Dial, never embed. `EmbeddedDaemon` (constructed at
   `sovereign/crates/sovereign-cli-daemon/src/daemon_cmd/mod.rs:1221`) is the
   last in-process composition and it goes.
3. An unreachable peer program is `CouldNotJudge` or absent, never empty.
4. Every decision visible at `tracing=debug`.
5. Config that can change without a code change is a file, not a constant.
6. A program never links another program's crates. Shared types live in
   `oicp-types` and `sovereign-contracts` only.

## 5. What the design does not contain

Deleted, not migrated: the in-process daemon; the two-name state database;
`sovereign/SYSTEM_OVERVIEW.md` and the drift machinery that keeps it honest;
the work atlas, claims, orders, campaigns, cursors, journals and demos under
`.sovereign/features/`; the canon store; notes injection; the ten-context
registry `quality/DOMAINS.toml` and its census script; `sovereign-server` as a
second host (the phone dials `svrn`); `studio` and `atos` unless a journey in
§7 reaches them. Each program gets one README under 500 lines. The gates that
survive are the ones with a fix command: size, boundary, layer, lock, env,
concept, and the two build scripts.

## 6. Measurements the design rests on (2026-09-17)

Cross-program crate edges, grouping today's crates by the five: assistant into
code intel 43, assistant into mesh 42, mesh into assistant 14, code intel into
assistant 10. Reference sites behind those edges: assistant runtime into code
intel 16 in 7 files; mesh into assistant 47 in 21 files; assistant api, daemon
and cli into commonwealth crates 463 in 63 files; `sovereign-tools` into
runtime and corpus 800 in 183 files, of which the `code/` module accounts for
187 runtime references and they are almost all the tool ABI (`Tool`,
`ToolContext`, `DeclaredTool`, `error`). `sovereign-tools` and
`sovereign-cli-llm` are each two programs in one crate. No coverage tooling is
installed. The bench does not gate conversation retrieval
(`sovereign/bench/README.md`).

## 7. Migration — the cut

Procedure, not plan. Every step has a command, a done condition and a stop
condition. Agents follow it; the operator closes the instrument table in step
3 and reads `kept-branches.tsv` in step 7. Nothing else is decided by an agent.

**Standing rules.** One cargo worker at a time, every cargo call through
`scripts/with-cargo-lock.sh`. No prose: code, a commit body in the fixed
format, nothing else. Subject `cut(<crate>): -<lines> <path>`; body exactly
`reached-by: none` and `restore: git show pre-cut:<path>`. A restore is by
name with the demanding instrument: `restore(<crate>): <fn> demanded-by
<instrument>`. No new capability until step 8 is green. Gate on exit codes.

**Step 0 — archive and clear the field.** `git tag pre-cut`. Delete
`sovereign/SYSTEM_OVERVIEW.md`, the drift tooling, and the process apparatus
listed in §5; drop `docs-gate` from `scripts/pre-push.sh` for the duration.
Done when the tag resolves and `./scripts/sovereign-lint.sh --human --full`
exits 0.

**Step 1 — toolchain.** `rustup component add llvm-tools-preview && cargo
install cargo-llvm-cov`. Done when `cargo llvm-cov --version` prints.

**Step 2 — instrumented build.**
```
source <(cargo llvm-cov show-env --export-prefix)
export LLVM_PROFILE_FILE="$PWD/target/llvm-cov-target/%p-%m.profraw"
cargo llvm-cov clean --workspace
scripts/with-cargo-lock.sh cargo build --workspace --bins --features corpus-engine/treesitter,sovereign-cli/dev-tools
```
Done when exit 0 and every `target/debug/sovereign-*` binary is newer than
the tag. Every step 3 command runs in this shell; a daemon started by launchd
inherits nothing and its run does not count.

**Step 3 — instruments.** The operator closes this table before the first
run; a surface with no row is being deleted on purpose and the tag message
says so. Cheap rows run twice and profiles are unioned. Done when every row
exited 0 and every bench lane reports `passed` or `failed`, not
`could-not-judge` or `never-ran`.

| Instrument | Command |
|---|---|
| bench, all lanes | `sovereign quality check` |
| conversation retrieval | a real journey, written before step 3 — the scaffold bank does not count |
| desktop chaos, kill-mid-turn included | `scripts/desktop-soak.py 30 --mode chaos` |
| desktop persona | `scripts/desktop-soak.py 30 --mode persona` |
| CLI journeys | `sovereign contract nightly` |
| pipeline, text | `sovereign pipeline run` over `sovereign-recipes/brothers-karamazov-book-1` |
| pipeline, code | `sovereign pipeline run` over the repo's own code recipe |
| mesh join | `scripts/mesh-soak.sh` |
| install and stale-lock start | `scripts/install-journey-nightly.sh`, then a start against a held run lock |
| migration | boot against a `pre-cut` data directory |

**Step 4 — report and bar.**
```
cargo llvm-cov report --json --output-path target/cut/cov.json
scripts/cut-report.py target/cut/cov.json > target/cut/functions.tsv
```
`cut-report.py` (written here if absent) emits one row per first-party
function, `crate file function line count`, aggregated by file and line range
with the max count across instantiations, and one summary line
`unreached_lines / first_party_lines = <ratio>`. Pre-registered bar, decided
before the number is read: continue only at 0.30 or above. Below it, stop; §9
is the plan instead.

**Step 5 — module cut.** A file is cut when every function in it has count
0. Leaves first: `git rm <file>`, fix `mod` and `use` lines only, lint,
commit. A pre-commit check in cut mode refuses any commit whose added lines
are not `mod` or `use` edits. Waves by crate, largest first, on a `cut`
branch that is not pushed until the final step 8. Done when the list is empty
and `sovereign-lint.sh --human --full` exits 0.

**Step 6 — tests.** `./scripts/sovereign-test.sh --human`. A failing test
whose subject was cut is deleted. A failing test whose subject was kept names
a cut function; restore it by file, `git checkout pre-cut -- <file>`, re-cut
the file under step 5. Done when exit 0.

**Step 7 — function cut.** For each count-0 row in a kept file:
`callers(<fn>)`. No callers, or every caller count 0: delete. Any reached
caller: keep, append to `target/cut/kept-branches.tsv`. The operator reads
the top fifty by line count; the rest stay kept. One crate per agent, leaves
first. Done when every count-0 row is deleted or listed and both scripts
exit 0.

**Step 8 — re-verify.** Uninstrumented build, then all of step 3 again.
A lane that moved from `passed` names its functions; restore per the rule;
repeat. Done when every lane's verdict equals its step 3 verdict.

**Step 9 — boundaries.** In `quality/ARCH_LAYERS.toml`: five `[[package]]`
rows, `svrn`, `ingest`, `cmnwlth`, `code`, `bench`; `[[forbid]]` rows
`cmnwlth -> svrn`, `svrn -> cmnwlth`, `svrn -> code`, `bench -> *` except
`oicp-types` and `sovereign-contracts`. `sovereign-tools` and
`sovereign-cli-llm` split by program before their rows land, each split done
when its in-crate containment test passes. Each red edge is one task: a
trait in a shared leaf or a wire call, done when green. Step done when
`cd corpus-engine && cargo xtask boundary-gate` exits 0.

**Step 10 — de-embed.** Fourteen construction sites of `EmbeddedDaemon`
outside `sovereign-daemon` become one dial through `sovereign-turn-client`.
Done when `grep -rn EmbeddedDaemon sovereign/crates --include=*.rs` returns
only the `cmnwlth` binary's own main.

**Step 11 — size lock.** `cargo xtask size-gate --tighten`, commit the
baseline, promote size-gate to blocking in `scripts/pre-push.sh`. Every push
after is net negative or its body names what the lines bought.

## 8. Predictions, written before step 4 runs

- The step 4 ratio is between 0.40 and 0.60. Below 0.30 kills the cut.
- The module cut alone removes over 300k first-party lines.
- Fewer than 40 restores are demanded by step 8 across all lanes.
- `sovereign-mesh` after the cut and split is under 25k lines, of which
  membership and reach are the majority.
- The `code/` lift needs no change to the twelve MCP tools it serves.

A prediction that misses is recorded in this file with the number, and the
step it invalidates is re-decided by the operator, not the agent.

## 9. If the bar is not met

Steps 9 through 11 run alone. The 118 crate edges become red forbid rows and
are fixed where they fail. That is the boundary cut without the reachability
cut, and it is what the `serving` package has been doing since 2026-09-14.

## 10. Risks accepted

A user of a path no journey exercises will hit a missing feature; the answer
is a restore with their report as the demanding instrument. The Windows leg
is cut and restored when `cargo-xwin check` goes red. Unreached means not
exercised, not unnecessary; step 7's reached-caller rule and step 3's failure
journeys are the only protection, and they are named so nobody believes the
cut proved more than it did.
